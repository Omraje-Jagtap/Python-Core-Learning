Concept:
A valid mobile number is a ten digit number starting with a 7,8 or 9.
Regular expressions are a key concept in any programming language.

Input Format:

 - The first line contains an integer N, the number of inputs.
 - N lines follow, each containing some string.

Constraints:

 - 1 <= N <= 10
 - 2 <= len(Number) <= 15

Output Format:

For every string listed, print "YES" if it is a valid mobile number and "NO"
if it is not on separate lines. Do not print the quotes.

Sample Input:

2
9587456281
